# ArchivesSpace Public User Interface Customizations

I forked my own PUI customizations from DU so I could work on them for Penn State. These are our customizations:

1. Changed the stylesheets so that they look like other Penn State websites
2. Updated `_record_innards.html.erb` to reflect local preferences for resource display
3. Changed the layout of the Welcome page so that the search form is above the about text
